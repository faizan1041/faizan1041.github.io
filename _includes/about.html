              <br/>
                <p>I'm a Freelance Web Developer by profession and love to program web applications which help in Marketing Automation and
		other tasks which let my clients be more productive in their online marketing stuff. I program wonderful apps on PHP, Ruby on 			Rails and Python.</p>
                <p>As most of the projects I worked on were demanded to be built on WordPress, WordPress theme and plugin development became 			my core interest and have written more than 15 themes from scratch which are owned by clients (references can be provided on 			demand, most of them can be seen <a href="http://faizan-ali.com/">on my website</a>).</p>

		<p>I can help you in following technical aspects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>WordPress Development (My all time favorite)</li>
				<li>Web Applications Development using PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python</li>
				<li>Joomla</li>
				<li>Magento</li>
				<li>Opencart</li>
				<li>SEO</li>
				<li>Solidworks (Yes, I still know Engineering Design)</li>
				<li>Working with different APIs such as Google Developers,Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and all kinds of Payment 				Processing and RESTful APIs.</li>
			</ul>
